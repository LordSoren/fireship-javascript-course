# Fireship Vanilla JS Course

I forked this repository so that I could more easily reference the source code used in the demo-videos.
the algorithms\my_answers.js file and .\MyDream\dreamClone folder contain my own work. In the latter, case, it was mostly done by copying things from the videos.
This was just for learning purposes.
